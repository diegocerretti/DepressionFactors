# StatisticsProject
Here you can find my project carried out during the Statistics course earlier this year.

I carried out a statistical inquiry on the main environmental and socio-economical factors of depression worldwide.

'Depression.R' is the file containing the statistical analysis carried out on R. 'OECD.xlsx' and 'Global.xlsx' correspond to the dataset exploited throughout the inquiry. 'The Environmental and Socio-economical Factors of Depression.pdf' contains the paper sharing our findings on the topic.
